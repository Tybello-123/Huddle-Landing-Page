## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
-SASS OR SCSS


### What I learned

During my experience with Sass, I gained proficiency in utilizing powerful features such as @mixins, @forward, and @use. These techniques significantly enhanced my codebase, enabling me to refactor and streamline my code while improving its readability and maintainability. By leveraging mixins, forward modules, and proper module organization, I achieved a more structured and manageable codebase, allowing for easier maintenance and future enhancements.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

@mixin footer-display-bg
{
    display: block;
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    overflow: contain;
}

@mixin footer-no-display-bg
{
    display: none;
   
}



### Continued development

--Addition of Javascript and React Functionalities
